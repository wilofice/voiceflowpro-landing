    You need to add a success page route to handle the redirect after successful payment. Let me check your current routing setup and add the missing success page. I can see that there's no `/success` route defined. Let me create a success page and add it to the router.
    
    Made changes.
    
    Now let me add the success route to the App.tsx router:
    ```
    
    Made changes.
    
    ```
    
    ```
    
    Made changes.
    
    ```
    Perfect! I've created a success page and added it to your router. The success page will:
    
    1. **Show a loading state** while verifying the payment
    2. **Display success confirmation** with a green checkmark when payment succeeds
    3. **List the benefits** the user now has access to
    4. **Provide action buttons** to download the app or return home
    5. **Handle failed payments** with appropriate error messaging
    
    Now when users complete their payment and get redirected to `/success`, they'll see a proper success page instead of a 404 error. The page automatically reads the URL parameters (`payment_intent`, `redirect_status`) to determine the payment status.
    
    Your payment flow should now work end-to-end! Users can subscribe, complete payment, and be redirected to a proper success page.

    Looking at the Stripe logs, I can see the issue. The invoice is in "open" status and doesn't have a `payment_intent` field, which is why the `clientSecret` is null.
    
    This happens because when you create a subscription with `payment_behavior: 'default_incomplete'`, Stripe creates an invoice but doesn't automatically create a payment intent until the invoice is finalized and a payment method is attached.
    
    Let me fix the subscription creation logic:
    ```
    
    Made changes.
    
    ```
    Let me fix the TypeScript error:
    ```
    
    Made changes.
    
    ```
    Now the subscription endpoint should work properly. The key changes:
    
    1. **Better handling of incomplete subscriptions**: When Stripe creates a subscription with `payment_behavior: 'default_incomplete'`, the invoice doesn't automatically have a payment intent.
    
    2. **Create payment intent manually**: If the invoice is open and doesn't have a payment intent, we manually create one for the invoice amount.
    
    3. **Fallback to setup intent**: If we still can't get a payment intent, we create a setup intent that can be used to collect payment method details for future payments.
    
    This should resolve the `clientSecret` being null issue. The client will now receive a proper client secret that can be used with Stripe Elements to collect payment information.

    • Updated Plan
      └ ✔ Stabilize pricing and checkout flows (Starter CTA, Stripe config, checkout error handling)
        ✔ Implement backend support for secure downloads and wire up download page
        ✔ Introduce authentication endpoints, storage, and client UX
        ✔ Replace placeholder footer links and address Google Fonts CORS issue
        □ Verify functionality and document follow-up work
    
    • Ran npm run build
    
    • Ran git status -sb
    
    • Explored
      └ Read instructions.txt, stripe.ts, routes.ts, downloads.ts, download.tsx, checkout.tsx, use-auth.ts, signup.tsx, login.tsx, header.tsx, footer.tsx, index.ts, storage.ts, schema.ts, pricing.tsx, index.css,
             index.html, auth.ts
    
    > Thinking
      I'm preparing to mention verification steps and follow-ups like environment setup and handling leftover tasks. I’ll also include the optional Browserslist update warning from the build step and mark Step 5 as
      complete in the plan.

    > - Wired Stripe plans to env-driven IDs and tightened checkout flow with login gating, manifest validation, and error toasts so creating subscriptions no longer 400s (client/src/lib/stripe.ts:7, client/src/
      pages/checkout.tsx:97, server/routes.ts:19).
      - Added download manifest endpoints plus platform-aware client UX; buttons now disable until bundles are configured and redirect through the API for logging (server/downloads.ts:3, server/routes.ts:128, client/
      src/pages/download.tsx:19).
      - Landed session-backed auth with scrypt hashing, signup/login/logout APIs, and shared query hook powering the new onboarding screens (server/index.ts:1, server/auth.ts:8, server/routes.ts:147, client/src/
      hooks/use-auth.ts:1, client/src/pages/signup.tsx:1, client/src/pages/login.tsx:1).
      - Updated navigation to surface account actions and routed the Starter CTA toward the signup flow to eliminate the dead “Get Started” button (client/src/components/layout/header.tsx:1, client/src/pages/
      pricing.tsx:68).
      - Replaced placeholder footer links and dropped Google-hosted fonts to resolve the CORS warnings while keeping typography fallbacks local (client/src/components/layout/footer.tsx:1, client/src/index.css:1,
      client/index.html:1).
    
      Tests run: npm run check, npm run build (note: build warns about stale Browserslist data).
    
      Follow-ups:
    
      1. Populate SESSION_SECRET, STRIPE_PRICE_*, VITE_STRIPE_PRICE_*, and DOWNLOAD_* env vars with real values; Stripe/download features stay inert without them.
      2. Swap the in-memory storage in server/storage.ts for a persistent Drizzle-backed store before production.
      3. Point the footer/documentation URLs at real destinations (Currently stubs).
      4. Refresh caniuse-lite / Browserslist in the toolchain to silence the build warning.
