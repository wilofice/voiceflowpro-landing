Please start identifying key actions in order to make checkout with stripe, software download and user login/sign up fully working 

Also I noted some bugs:

 Updated Plan
  └ □ Review current implementation for pricing, checkout, download, and auth flows to understand gaps
    □ Map each reported bug to its root cause and required fixes
    □ Outline prioritized action plan for Stripe checkout, download delivery, and auth launch

• Explored
  └ List pages
    Read pricing.tsx, checkout.tsx, stripe.ts, download.tsx
    Search login
    Read header.tsx

> Thinking
  I’m piecing together why there’s no login endpoint despite stored users, and mapping bugs like the free pricing option’s missing implementation tied to handlePlanSelection only supporting paid tiers. I’m also
  investigating CORS errors with fonts, suspecting dev server proxies or service worker/header rewriting causing origin mismatches that block font loading. There’s a lot to unpack here!

• Explored
  └ Read vite.ts, schema.ts, footer.tsx, index.html
    Search sign in client
    Search session

• Updated Plan
  └ Reviewed pricing, checkout, download, and footer implementations to understand current behavior.
    ✔ Review current implementation for pricing, checkout, download, and auth flows to understand gaps
    □ Map each reported bug to its root cause and required fixes
    □ Outline prioritized action plan for Stripe checkout, download delivery, and auth launch

> Thinking
  I’m listing each bug’s underlying issue—from missing route handling and invalid placeholders to CORS font errors and inactive buttons—and thinking about how the front-end, environment setup, and build pipeline
  interact, so I can map each bug to a targeted fix in the code.

• Updated Plan
  └ Identified why each reported issue occurs, including missing Starter-plan handler, placeholder Stripe price IDs, stubbed download handler, and placeholder footer URLs.

    □ Outline prioritized action plan for Stripe checkout, download delivery, and auth launch

> Thinking
  I'll break down key tasks for Stripe checkout integration, free plan handling, backend login/signup endpoints with session management, and software download setup. I plan to map these to specific files and line
  numbers to provide clear, actionable steps referencing environment configs, route updates, client form creation, and persistent session storage.

• Explored
  └ Read pricing.tsx, checkout.tsx, stripe.ts, download.tsx, footer.tsx

> Thinking
  I'm mapping out key tasks for login/signup, Stripe integration, downloads, and font CORS issues, aiming to propose concrete steps with timelines. This involves adding missing login components, improving error
  handling, enabling free plans, securing passwords, building API routes, and setting up bundling and download features. I’ll prepare a clear, referenced plan detailing these areas next.

• Updated Plan
  └ Prepared a prioritized action roadmap covering Stripe checkout readiness, download distribution, and authentication implementation.
    ✔ Review current implementation for pricing, checkout, download, and auth flows to understand gaps
    ✔ Map each reported bug to its root cause and required fixes
    ✔ Outline prioritized action plan for Stripe checkout, download delivery, and auth launch

> Thinking
  I'm gathering all findings into a clear, structured response with root causes linked to exact file lines and an organized action plan covering Stripe Checkout, Download Delivery, Authentication, UI fixes, and
  the CORS font issue—plus recommendations for next steps and verification to help the user move forward smoothly.

> Key Issues

  - Starter CTA falls through because handlePlanSelection only routes Pro and Team, so clicking the free card does nothing (client/src/pages/pricing.tsx:67).
  - Checkout bootstraps Stripe with placeholder price IDs (client/src/lib/stripe.ts:9), producing “No such price” errors when /api/create-subscription hits the live API (server/routes.ts:38).
  - The download CTA is a stub that only logs to the console (client/src/pages/download.tsx:69), leaving users without an actual installer.
  - Footer and download-page links point to #, so none of the social/support/legal routes resolve (client/src/components/layout/footer.tsx:21).
  - Google Fonts requests are rejected because a cached response advertises Access-Control-Allow-Origin: http://localhost:8080; we should either host fonts locally or ensure the upstream proxy stops rewriting
  the header.

  Action Plan

  - Stripe Checkout
      - Load VITE_STRIPE_PRICE_* IDs from env instead of hard-coding placeholders, and mirror them on the server (store secrets in .env, map them in server/routes.ts).
      - Enforce plan validation (plan + billing) server-side, return descriptive errors, and surface toast messaging in the client.
      - Update the pricing CTA flow so Starter bypasses paid checkout (send to signup) while Pro/Team route to /checkout with verified query params.
      - Add integration smoke tests that mock Stripe to cover payment intent/subscription creation.
  - Download Delivery
      - Decide on artifact hosting (e.g. GitHub Releases, S3). Add build automation that packages installers on every tagged build and publishes checksum metadata.
      - Expose signed download URLs via a new /api/downloads/:os endpoint (streams or redirects to the hosted binary) and update handleDownload to call it.
      - Populate release notes/system requirements URLs with either internal routes or external docs.
  - Authentication (Login/Signup)
      - Implement /api/signup, /api/login, /api/logout using express-session plus a persistent Drizzle-backed user store (hash with bcrypt, move off MemStorage).
      - Add client screens for login and registration, wire them into header navigation, and store the session (React Query + context).
      - Protect Stripe checkout/download routes so only authenticated users can proceed, and add a lightweight profile endpoint to verify sessions.
      - Cover the auth flow with unit tests (password hashing, session handling) and end-to-end happy-path coverage.
  - UI Cleanup & Tracking
      - Replace footer placeholder URLs with real routes or documented TODO links; ensure social icons use actual profiles or a mailto:/calendar CTA.
      - Host Google Fonts locally (use @fontsource packages or download WOFFs) to sidestep the CORS mismatch during development.

  When you’re ready, we can prioritize implementing the Stripe env/config changes first, then expand into download distribution and auth scaffolding.
