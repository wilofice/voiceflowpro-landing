### **üîç SEO Optimization Additions:**
```
SEO REQUIREMENTS:

- Secondary keywords: "audio transcription software", "whisper transcription online"
- Meta title: "VoiceFlow Pro - Professional Audio Transcription | MacWhisper Alternative"
- Meta description: "Professional transcription software that works on any device. Unlike MacWhisper's Mac-only limitation, VoiceFlow Pro offers team collaboration and privacy-first processing."
- H1, H2, H3 structure for optimal SEO

```

The main prompt I created is **comprehensive and production-ready**. When you submit it to Replit, you'll get a landing page that:

‚úÖ **Positions VoiceFlow Pro as the clear MacWhisper upgrade**  
‚úÖ **Appeals to the 87% non-Mac market MacWhisper can't serve**  
‚úÖ **Emphasizes collaboration and modern workflow features**  
‚úÖ **Includes conversion-optimized copy and design**  
‚úÖ **Provides clear pricing strategy with free trial**  
‚úÖ **Builds trust through testimonials and social proof**

**Pro tip:** After Replit generates the initial version, you can ask for specific refinements like "make the comparison table more prominent" or "add more animation to the hero section" to perfect the final result.

This landing page will be a **powerful sales tool** that clearly communicates why users should choose VoiceFlow Pro over MacWhisper and other alternatives!
