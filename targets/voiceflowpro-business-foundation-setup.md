- **Critical path**: Legal docs ‚Üí Business registration ‚Üí Payment integration ‚Üí Go-live

### **üí∏ Investment Required**
- **Upfront**: $2,850-4,200 (mostly one-time legal/registration costs)
- **Monthly**: $150-550 ongoing business expenses
- **Break-even**: ~500 paid users to cover ongoing costs

### **üö¶ Priority Order (Start This Week)**
1. **Day 1-2**: Legal document drafting (highest priority - affects everything else)
2. **Day 3-4**: Business registration & trademark filing (long lead times)
3. **Day 5-7**: Payment integration (builds on existing auth system)
4. **Day 8-10**: Branding & final integration (can be done last)

### **‚ö†Ô∏è Critical Dependencies**
